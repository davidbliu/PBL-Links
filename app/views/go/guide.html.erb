<h1 class = 'middle-title'>PBL Links</h1>
		<p>PBL Links is a custom URL shortener for PBL. This project was inspired by “Go Links,” which are used at LinkedIn for a similar purpose. PBL Links has two main goals: simplifying the way we <b>access and discover resources</b> in PBL.</p>

<h3 class = 'middle-title'>Our aim is to provide you</h3>

<h4>Quick access to PBL data</h4>
	<p>You can access any PBL Resource as pbl.link/resource. examples are <a href = 'http://pbl.link/mission'>pbl.link/mission</a>, <a href = 'http://pbl.link/contact-sheet'>pbl.link/contact-sheet</a>, and <a href = 'http://pbl.link/piazza'>pbl.link/piazza</a></p>
<h4>Standardized interface to PBL data</h4>
	<p>All PBL Resources will be catalogued on our PBL Link Catalogue, enabling members to access any PBL Resource via it's alias and search for the research on the PBL Link Catalogue</p>
<h4>Custom Tools for PBL Resources</h4>
	<p>Some examples are favorites, trending and starred links, and monitoring. Members can favorite PBL Links to bookmark them on the home page of the portal. Execs and Officers can flag PBL Links to trend on the Portal's front page. PBL Links also allows chairs and officers to gauge engagement with PBL Resources through tools like "Who's viewed my link"</p>

<h3 class = 'middle-title'>PBL Resources are the new form of information currency</h3>

<p>We can only achieve these goals by formalizing what a PBL Resource is. <b>A PBL Resource is anything that has been saved as a PBL Link</b>. PBL Resources are the new form of information currency, and when we create PBL Resources we are promised
	<ul>
		<li>Our Resource can be passed</li>
		<li>Our Resource can be found in the PBL Link Catalogue</li>
		<li>Our Resource can be monitored</li>
		<li>Our Resources will be persisted</li>
	</ul>
These are guarantees are <b>only afforded to PBL Resources</b>. Non-PBL Resources are still useful for scratch work and quick communication between members, but they are not provided the same promises as PBL Resources. Most notably <b>Non PBL Resources cannot be expected to be viewed.</b> Documents like Novum chalking signups, the reimbursement form, and scripts between committees must be made into PBL Links if we expect other members to view and respond to the document. Even articles we wish to spread to PBL need to be PBL-Linkified. Documents that are not PBL Links should not be circulated through PBL (though they can be used between members like two HT CMs scripting their PBLTV, for example).

<h3 class = 'middle-title'>PBL Links Components</h3>
<p>To get started using PBL Links here are the three main components: <b>PBL Links</b>, <b>PBL Link Catalogue</b>, and <b>PBL Link Chrome Extension</b>
</p>

<h4>PBL Links</h4>
<p>At it's very simplest, a PBL Links is a key/alias and a URL. when you visit pbl.link/key you are redirected to the URL saved behind that key. A key can only point to one URL whereas one URL can be pointed to by multiple keys (for example pbl.link/mission and pbl.link/mission-statement could be configured to point to the same document). Keys can be overrited, however. For example, pbl.link/chalking could be reset each chalking cycle to point to the current chalking sign up sheet.


<h4>PBL Link Catalogue</h4>
<p>PBL Link Catalogue is how to can search and discover any link previously created by your peers. Our catalogue has a <b>3-ply directory structure.</b> Each PBL Link belongs to a directory and a directory can be as many as three levels deep. You can browse through directories by clicking into them on the right of the Catalogue or by scrolling to them. Our Catalogue also provides a search bar. You can search Links by their name, their description, or even by the content within the link. For example searching "david liu" may return the contact-sheet and any other documents that contain "david liu" within the document.</p>

<h4>PBL Link Chrome Extension</h4>
<p>The Chrome Extension allows you to use PBL Links on the go. You can use the Chrome Extension to lookup the current URL in PBL Links, add new links, and search for previously created PBL Links</p>
