	<p>Trello is a task management system that can help you and your committee stay on track! We have integrated Trello with PBL Portal to deliver a seamless experience managing tasks in PBL. While we recommend that you start using Trello yourself, you can perform much of the functionality directly from the portal!</p>

	<h2>How it works</h2>
	<p>We have automatically generated a task board at <a href = 'http://pbl.link/trello' target = '_blank'>pbl.link/trello</a> that the Portal updates automatically.</p>
